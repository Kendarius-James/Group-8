### Description:
The goal of our group is to design and develop an e-commerce website that will have 
a number of functionalities based on the customers expectations. The website will provide 
the ability for a user to create a listing of an item they would like to sell, and provide a way
for buyers to search through items with categories tagged to each listing. Listings will be 
monitored by admin accounts to ensure no inappropriate items are being sold, Admins will also 
review reported listings and determine their removal.

### Features:
The platform will be able to perform the following functionalities.
- Users with different roles (Buyer, Seller, Admin) should be able to login into their
accounts to be able to perform various actions such as creating a listing, checkout their
cart, and report listings seen as inappropriateand to be later reviewed by an admin. All 
users will also be able to logout of their account.
- A buyer should be able to search, compare, buy and return different types of products
from different sellers, each item will have category tags that the buyer will be able to search
through, and compare items based on price and the product rating along with the seller rating.
- A seller should be able to create listings of various quantity, and receive payments for 
after one of their products has been purchased.
- An admin should be able to approve/block new user accounts and products, and review
reported listings to determine if they are to be deleted or not.
